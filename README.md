Project Overview 
-
In this analysis, I explored the data provided by Manilo Enterprises across the retailers to derive insight into how their performance was for the 2014 sales year. The goal was to uncover patterns, identify growth opportunities, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance profitability and efficiency.

Introduction
-
Manilo Enterprises is a shipping company that specializes in moving consumer products for business owners. These shipments are conducted from North to South and East to West for the businesses that do not have the resources to ship items they sell.  Gaining insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency is essential for sustaining a competitive edge and optimizing business strategy.

Project Objectives
-
- Which city generates the most revenue?
- Who is the most efficient salesperson based on the performance analysis?
- How does sales performance differ by cities and products?
- What are the monthly trends spotted?

Recommendations
-
## 🔹 Individual Performance
- **Jan**: Due to consistently low performance, it is recommended that Jan be scheduled for additional training and mentorship.
- **Nancy**: Recognition or encouragement is suggested in light of her outstanding performance throughout the year.

## 🔹 Company Recognition
- **Company D**: Given their exceptional yearly performance, they are a strong candidate for the "Company of the Year" award.

## 🔹 Strategy Replication
- The **tactics implemented in December**, which led to a notable performance spike, should be analyzed and **replicated in underperforming months**.

## 🔹 Regional Insights
- Identify top-performing salespersons residing in the **Northern Region**, analyze their strategies, and **share these best practices with the Western Region** for possible replication.

## 🔹 Product Focus
- All sales staff should be advised to **pay closer attention to the Beverages category**, as it's currently the best-selling product. Sustaining and increasing sales in this category is a high priority.

## 🔹 Logistics & Expansion
- Consider setting up a **Headquarters (HQ)** or fulfillment center to attract **more customers seeking lower shipping fees**, thereby enhancing competitive edge.

## ✅ Conclusion
These recommendations aim to improve sales performance across all levels — individual, team, regional, and product-based. By recognizing excellence, addressing underperformance, and replicating successful strategies, the organization can strengthen its market position and drive consistent growth.
